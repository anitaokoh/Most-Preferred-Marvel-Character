## About data

The data used was gotten from [here](https://gist.github.com/Mentrasto/967148a4b41713977839).

It entails 26 Marvel Character : be it hero or villian, rated on six super abilities like strength , speed, fighting combat etc

## About Project

This project was done solely on **SQLITE** and the measure of tendency used is the **average mean**. Six super abilities were averaged and all 26 characters were judged on theses averages in order to get the most powerful or most preferred based on abilities.

You can find the queries used in the file above entitled  `marvel.sql`

Although it is a small database, the code used can be applied to a bigger data so feel free to scrap more data from [here](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Database) and reuse the queries

I also wrote an article about it so you can read about the concluding result here

**SPOILER ALERT:** It was Rogue. SEE WHY.

There is also a  **Bonus** analysis to calculate the **BODY MASS INDEX**(BMI) of each character and categorize them as obese and healthy etc. You can also find the code in the file above named `marvel.sql` and in the article as well here.
